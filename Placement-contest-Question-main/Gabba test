Problem Statement
Australia hasnâ€™t lost a Test Match at the Gabba since 1988. India has to win this one, but unfortunately all of their players are injured.

You are given the following information:
1. A total of N players are available, all are injured initially.
2. You have M magic pills. Using X pills, you can make any one player fit for match.
3. Alternatively, you can exchange any player for Y magic pills.

Compute the maximum number of players you can make fit for the Gabba Test Match.
Note: "Exchanging" a player means that player will no longer be available and you will gain Y extra magic pills for the exchange



Input
The input contains a single line containing 4 integers N M X Y.
