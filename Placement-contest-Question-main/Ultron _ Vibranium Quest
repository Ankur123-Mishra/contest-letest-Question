Problem Statement
There is a room filled with ‘V’ kg of vibranium and Ultron wants his robot army to get the vibranium from that room. 
N robots are sent with the value of vibranium each of them has to bring. For each i the ith robot wants to bring ‘Ai’ amount of vibranium. 
Robots come in and try to take vibranium one by one in increasing order of their indices. Whenever a robot tries to take vibranium from the room,
if the room has at least required amount of vibranium, then only the robot gets the vibranium otherwise the robot has to return without any vibranium. 
Each robot determine whether they will get the required amount of vibranium or not.


Input
The First line consists of two integers N( Number of robots ) and V ( Total amount of vibranium in the room ).
The next line of input contains N space separated integers depicting the A1, A2. AN.
