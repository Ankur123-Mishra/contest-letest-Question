Problem Statement
shubham and maruti play a game. Maruti has n cards, and the i- th of them has the integer ai written on it.
Bob has m cards, and the j- th of them has the integer bj written on it.
On the first turn of the game, the first player chooses one card and puts it on the table (plays it). 
On the second turn, the second player chooses one card such that the integer on it is greater than the integer on the card played on the first turn, and plays it.
On the third turn, the first player chooses one card such that the integer on it is greater than the integer on the card played on the second turn, and plays it,
and so on continues.
The players take turns, and each player has to choose one of his/her cards with a greater integer than the card played by the other player on the last turn.

who wins if Maruti is the first player?
Print Maruti if "Maruti" wins else "Shubham" without quotes.


Input
The first line consists of two space-separated integers n and m.
The second line contains n space-separated integers elements of the array a having cards of Maruti.
