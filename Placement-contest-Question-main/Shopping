Problem Statement
Toros went to the supermarket to buy K items. There were a total of N items. Each item had a distinct price Pi. He is cost-effective, so he would buy the K cheapest item. But he knows that the more cheaper an item is, the more is the chances that it can be defective. So he planned to ignore 2 cheapest items and buy K from the remaining ones.
Find the total cost of all items that he would buy.


Input
The first line contains two integers N and K, denoting the total number of items in the supermarket and the number of items Toros is going to buy.
The second line contains N distinct integers Pi , denoting the prices of the items
