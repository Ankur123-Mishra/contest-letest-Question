Problem Statement
Given a sorted array of N integers a[], and Q queries. For each query, you will be given a positive integer K and your task is to print the number of elements in array a[] that are smaller than or equal to K.


Input
In case of Java only
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function smallerElements() that takes the array a[],
integer N and integer k as arguments.



Custom Input
The first line of input contains a single integer N.
The second line of input contains N space- separated integers depicting the values of the array.
The third line of input contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.
Each of the next Q lines of input contain a single integer, the value of K.

        int ans=0;
        while(first<=last){
                int mid=(first+last)/2;
                if(k<a[mid]){
                        last=mid-1;
                        ans = mid;
                }
                else{
                        first=mid+1;
                        ans=first;
                }
        }
        return ans;
}
